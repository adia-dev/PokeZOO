# PokeZOO

PokeZOO is a fun project that aims to create a virtual zoo made up of animated Pokemon sprites. The entities to be drawn in the zoo will be fetched from the PokeAPI, and the project is built using a combination of WebAssembly, C++, SDL, React, and TypeScript.

### Demo

The project is available to view at the following URL: https://pokezoo.fly.dev/

Hosted by [Fly.io](https://fly.io/)

### Note

You might need to `refresh` the page a few times, there is a known issue implying that the `mainf` function cannot be called.
A fix for that will come soon.
